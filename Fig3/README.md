# Code used to generate figure 3 and supplemental figure 2.

### Figure3_sim_final.R:

Code used to sample the posterior distribution of MCMV parameters, and simulate the model for pathogen reduction.

### process_sampled_sims.py:

Takes the output from Figure3_sim_final.R, and calculates the minimum, maximum, and modal pathogen reduction values. 

### Figure3_final.R:

Takes the output from process_sampled_sims.py, and generates Figure 3 in the main text and Figure 2 in the SI.
